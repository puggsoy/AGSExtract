# AGSExtract

Resource extractor for Adventure Game Studio games. Credit to [rofl0r's agsutils](https://github.com/rofl0r/agsutils), (in particular Clib32.c), which is where I got most of the format information from.

As of now it only supports one type of game (version 15), in the future support for other versions will be added.
